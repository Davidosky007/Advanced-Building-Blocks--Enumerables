# Advanced-Building-Blocks--Enumerables
This project is based on the Odin Project of Enumerable methods. We created our own methods on to the existing Enumerable module without using original methods and with yield statement or #call method.



## About the Project
In This Project  we Rebuild custom methods and make them do the same functions following best practices.
code is written following the community Ruby Style Guide[![Ruby Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-rubocop-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop)
